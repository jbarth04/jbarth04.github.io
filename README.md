1) Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what  
   have not:

   I believe both my HTML and CSS files are implemented correctly.  

2) Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment:

    I ask Max Bernstein some github questions, but nothing specifically 
    related to my portfolio.


3) Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment:

    I spent about ten hours completing this assignment.  A lot of time was 
    spent researching how to make an image and text a single unit for my
    homepage.  I'm excited about my homepage layout because I think it'll 
    translate well to a mobile app layout.  I want to make a css file
    to accommodate mobile viewing for my next project.
