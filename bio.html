    <h1> About Me </h1>

    Hi, I’m Josie.  I am a student at Tufts University studying Computer Science.  College was my first exposure to programming, and I’m excited to I find myself in such a dynamic field where both opportunity and learning seem boundless.  I’m an active member of Tufts’ Women in Computer Science group and serve as the External Logistics Officer, where I am in charge of communications, event planning, and alumnae networking.  Women in Computer Science is important to me as it was the first STEM space where I felt my gender wasn’t judged as a barrier to my intelligence and creativity.

    I grew up in the small seaside town of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, and I consider myself a New Englander through and through.  Though my fondness of home has never hindered my desire to travel, and before beginning my studies at Tufts I took gap year.  I composed my own itinerary and consulted friends who had taken gap years for program and destination recommendations.   My year brought me to Thailand, Nepal, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama, and Arizona, where I did a mix between volunteer work, independent travel, and farming.  I am throughly grateful for these experiences, and some of my fondest memories include learning how to surf in Peru, farming on a dude ranch in Arizona, spotting a whale shark while scuba diving in Thailand, and watching the sunrise over the Himalayas in Nepal.

    In my free time, I like to read, spend time with my family, swim in the ocean, hike in the woods, work at my grandparents' farm, and eat just about anywhere in Portland, Maine.
